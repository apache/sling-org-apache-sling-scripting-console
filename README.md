# Apache Sling Script Console

It is now deprecated in favor of the similar but improved [Apache Felix Script Console Plugin](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-script-console-plugin.html). For reference or potential bugfix releases use the [maintenance](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-scripting-console/tree/maintenance) branch, which contains this module's code as it was just before deprecating it.
